\question{1}{For your response paper, just write up any reflections, thought, questions, etc. that came to mind while watching the lecture and reading the above paper!}

	\part{1}{Questions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Was the TRIGA reactor a part of the NPT treaty?
		\item Does the pool water ever get emptied in the BWR?
		\item Why do the cool down towers have that iconic shape of being "slim in the middle but wider at the top and bottom"?
		\item Was there a similar anti-nuclear movement in Russia following Chernobyl or was it squashed by the Russian Government since it kind of downplays their nuclear capabilities?
	\end{itemize}

	\part{2}{Other stuff about how I feel about stuff}
