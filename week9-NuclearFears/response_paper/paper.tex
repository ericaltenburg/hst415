\question{2}{What do you make of the Cohn article? What's the argument? How can you apply her analysis to what we've done in this class so far?}

\question{3}{\textit{If you get to them...} what are your thoughts on "Duck and Cover" and "The House in the Middle"? Do you find them compelling as communicative media? (From a factual perspective, they are both \textit{correct for their context}, but that doesn't mean they communicate that well.) Why or why not? What would Cohn say about these (especially "The House in the Middle")?}
