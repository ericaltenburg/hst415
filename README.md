Notes and Papers from HST 415 - The Nuclear Era at Stevens Institute of Technology (F20).

## Description

The course provides an overview of the nuclear era, starting with its beginnings during WWII. It demonstrates how developments in scientific research and technological development drove the creation of an immense military-industrialacademic enterprise. The Cold War precipitated an arms race that led to a new social reality based upon Mutually Assured Destruction. Students will learn how nuclear weapons have shaped international relations in the 21st Century, how non-state entities and the related possibilities of nuclear terrorism have come into prime focus, and how societies have integrated the production of nuclear energy. They also will gain a greater appreciation for the cultural novelties of the nuclear era, as well as for the changing social and political contexts of decision-making. Throughout the whole course, the existential threat of nuclear weapons technologies will be examined and discussed.
